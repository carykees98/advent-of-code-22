# Advent of Code - 2022

This is the code for my attempt at AoC 2022, this was also my first time participating in the event.

Each day contains the source ```.cpp``` file as well as the data set that I used for solving that days problem. Each solution was built using the C++17 standard.

I also rewrote some of the days solutions in another language for practice and the source for the other language is also in that day's folder.


## ```newday``` tool

I created a tool to generate a new folder for each day which can be built by running ```make newday``` then ran using ```./newday```.

The program asks what day you are on so that the directory its files are accuratly named.
